            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rohit Gurunath Sharma, born on <b>30 April 1987</b> in Nagpur, Maharashtra, India, is widely regarded as one
            of the greatest cricketers of all time. As of 2025, he is 38 years old and stands at 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm) tall.
            Known for his elegant right-handed batting style and ability to score massive centuries with effortless
            timing, Rohit has earned a special place in world cricket. He also bowls right-arm off break occasionally,
            though his primary role is that of a top-order batsman. Popularly nicknamed <b>“Hitman”</b> for his destructive
            batting and <b>“G.O.A.T” (Greatest Of All Time)</b> by fans, Rohit Sharma’s journey from a promising young
            talent to the captain of the Indian national team reflects his dedication, consistency, and deep passion for the game,

            his greatness on the cricket field. He is a family-oriented person, deeply values relationships, and is also
            a well-known animal lover 🐶, reflecting his compassionate personality. Rohit is known for his discipline,
            simplicity, and grounded attitude, believing strongly in hard work over noise, consistency over hype, and
            respect for the game above all else.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He represents a true rise from struggle, a late bloomer who never gave up, and a cricketer who achieved
            extraordinary records with elegance and leadership with calmness. Rohit Sharma shows the world that
            “you don’t need to be loud to be legendary.” In every sense, Rohit Sharma is not just a cricketer—he is an era,
            an emotion, and truly the <b>G.O.A.T of Indian Cricket</b>.
